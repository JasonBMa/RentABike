# RentABike
For Aggie Works take home assignment, creating a site that reserve bikes for vistors.

Initialize Server before client so client can grab listings from back end.

## Setup
### rent-a-bike (Server)
Runs on localhost:5000
```
cd bicycle-exchange
npm run dev
```

### bicycle-exchange (Client)
Runs on localhost:3000
```
cd bicycle-exchange
npm start
```

## Use
Clicking on post opens a ui to input name. <br>
*Need to implement* <br>
From this point you are able to reserve using REST api to send to backend.
